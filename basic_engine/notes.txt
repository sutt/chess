Goal: Generic ObjectOriented Game Enigne

Edge cases:
    pawn, en passant
    castling
    
Other weird things: 
    pawn-promotion
    king must move out of check
    king cannot move into check
    other peices can't move in a way that puts king in check

figure out inheritance of a king(piece)

make a turn-engine
    x make random moves
    x allow input to control a player

king and enpassant-vulnerable-pawn are needed as enums on board

Long-Term:
    calculate all get_diags get_across etc for each position into a lookup table
    can cache available moves to each piece and use in next turn


why does the debug break in VScode on print IOError?
    > print rook_moves
    > IOError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory
    everyone since Fall Creator updates has this:
        https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode/issues/36630

board should store edge cases:
     king_can_castle, rook_can_castle, en_passant_vulnerable [0,1,,0,0]...

    -> so that, piece.get_available_moves(board) is full evaulation
       not: piece.get_available_moves(board, white's pawns, etc...)

    as i realized, checkmate detector is not difficult, it is only:
        -available_moves [where king not in check] = {} ("empty set")
        -check_flag = True
    -> so the real heart of the game is calc'ing is_king_in_check

    modular idea: what if board.data was a numpy array? smaller mem and faster?

    #NOTE - how to get out of check? all moves filtered by king_in_check
            #   but how to handle killing the checking piece?

    TODO:
        refactor data_by_player

        add exit code for total number of moves to allow random play

        build tests for king in check in specific situations

        add perf_test.py to time play()

            add a bool to game to turn on/off filter_king_check()
            check the difference in time

            add perf_test_log to GameLog to collect granular timing
               data and additional info at each step

        build analyze_perf_test to analyze num_moves vs time_compute, etc.

    Ahh so optimal is O(n) * c where c is in [1,4]

    there are multiple optimizations:
        
        instead of copying the board, just set different positions,
        and then set them back as you exit function. (or is that even needed?) 
            (this could be wrong for en passant situations, 
                so dont run this optimize if this is so )

        how about "piping" moves from get_available -> filter_check
            this involves async in py3?

        using numpy instead of list of list
        using a 64char string instead of a list

        using superking instead of all opponent's pieces

        pre-computation+lookup for piece.get_moves() instead of on-the-spot calc

    so the initial abstraction of piece kills opponents piece regardless of rank
    breaks down here, as the king is special. we already knew that with check_flag 
    but that is poor because a. it's arduous to compute move_yourself_into_check 
    in O(n^2) and b. it doesnt capture the idea of moving so as to place opponent 
    in check.

    Ah, but none of the atomic-moves overlap thus the move_type and move can be parsed
    after exiting blocking_piece() at the bottom of get_available()

    Playful aside: like in poker with 'Hand' as a concept, 'check' is an ambiguous
    and overused concept in chess.

        investigate pieces.pop() issue?
        

    a better name for super-king is mirror-piece: "if it can kill you, you can kill it"
    or an anti-king: "can attack only when in check"
        this is like a queen plus a horse but can't kill pawns head-on
        and cant kill king except directly adjacent
        but it doesn't neccesarily move unless attacking.
        ahh but what if oppoent piece cant kill it because doing so would put 
        himself in check? can the mirror-piece still attack opponent, except with king
        where he cant kill it because that would put him in check

        does check_optimal work with pawns? prolly not right now

        think about how to mutate board instead of apply_rule
            do you need pos0? or pos1?
            do you need to account for kill_piece popping? - (yes)
            and how does this change in check_opponent vs 
                dont_move_self_into_check

            so i think you need pos0 only on dont_move_self_into_check,
                (for everything execpt castling, and king moves)
                but you need pos1 only on opponent_check. True?

            so essentially if MOVE_CODE == 'regular' then do mirror, 
            otherwise do naive could work

        how do you isolate get_available_moves() time from full turn loop?

        Takeaways

            There is the notion of move or turn characteristics / features.
            Here we build an engine which minimizes computation time, and thus
            construct the bare number of features available, 

            THIS WAS ALL BAD SPECULATION DOWN A RABBIT HOLE

                e.g. not checking for check at the end/beginning of the turn.

                There might be some weird/theoretical cases where castling is a 
                valid escape sowe can identify those individually and test for 
                them in a sub-module?

                The unintuitive notion this exercises exposes is "Don't move a piece such
                that it puts yourself in check" is a rather estoric rule, but it is the only
                rule neccessary for computing: legal_moves, and end_game.
                This is because people don't build a list of all possible legal spaces each
                turn, instead they focus on five or six, and thus the verbal "check" helps
                them refocus their search.
                This also suggests that an AI would do well to limit its considerations
                to ~5 moves each turn, not every legally permissible one.

            Actually there is a good optimization to do here:
                If the king has len(opp_kill_moves) == 0 at the beggining of turn, 
                when you check is_king_in_check() then don't bother doing a mirror
                except with the move is associated with king.
                -> TODO: get a bunch or real life games and see when this comes 
                        into effect

                NOPE - this is all wrong speculation again; mirror_flag uses board
                pos to assess blocking pieces. 
                
                Still, there seems something to notion that opponents pieces
                don't move during your turn, thus some kind shortcut?

                    Maybe 'bypass' the first piece of yours in filter_blocking()
                    and cache that pos as in list_calc_needed when another piece
                    is validated as a threat. Then only run 
                    mirror on a move where pos0 is in list_calc_needed. A "moving
                    away a blocker" type move; implied is you can never add to possibility
                    of being in check based on where you end up.

                To consider: enpassant is the one move where pos1 != kill_pos, and that
                             oppoent pawn could be blocking check, with no piece there
                             to replace it.
                

                        
        
    Takeaway 1/30

        check out Mirror class for a pattern for building up a list of 
        increasingly large and informative tuples. But could this be accomplished
        in the other direction for each move, go through all the steps...?

        can't you just build list<-map() for each step      

        overall, a pretty good way to build 'a mirror image piece in OO chess engine'
        but YMMV. why:

            - encapsulation of functions, even staticmoves dont crowd into other modules

            - it represents one esoteric, isolated, confusing concept - that these 
            three pieces of information - move_type, move_paces, piece_class - can
            allow you to deduce if king is in check (or any piece in general is threatend)
            and this doesnt get applied or depended on anywhere else.            

            - it allows you to build up a naming motif in a completely enclosed scope

            - it allows you to build up a processing motif e.g 
              self.var2 = [func(x) for x in self.var]

            - shows you clearly what are inputs and outputs to this processing, and if
              any special order is needed

            - modularizes comments to its atomic concern: you can't about Hypothetical
              code changes that might affect this instruction while proc procedurally




    

    Idea for perf analysis:

    BUT: the below doesnt work becaused it has to occur for each-piece-move tuple
        same as iterating of opponent's possible moves. Instead we need a 
        list of positions on the board that help keep king out of check for non-king moves
        these dont include horse moves because horse is never blocked.
        Only when one of these pieces is proposed moved could the king be threatened.
        Note: this only occurs when a piece MOVES AWAY, not where it moves TO.
        This set of own-players pieces, calcd before each turn, is what hypo-king
        helps us calculate.

    it will be a lot faster to model is_king_in_check 
    without iterating across all opponents pieces possible moves 
    which runs in  O(piece-moves^2) or O(piece-moves * 2) (?)
    instead create a King-Hypothetical class which has all other pieces'
    moves and see if it "can kill" an opponents piece of the class that
    has the move type, which should be on the order of O(piece-move) 
    little higher than Queen's O(piece-move).
    You might also be able to cache the result, and only recalculate
    if a certain piece "assuring" it remains in position is moved.

    you can test the bigO-time by changing BOARD_WIDTH = 9,10,11,...
    you can test practical perf by taking random moves, or importing
    saved chess games and running total time it takes to calc all
    get_available_moves() using each method

    1/27 Thoughts:
        - it is O(n^2) if you think of piece-moves, and the most naive algo
         - to make the board wider, you need to handle castling better with board_width param

Takeaways:

    1/27
    software engineering and team-code practices become important at the point where
    one nice abstraction no longer encapsulates the whole requirements: in this case
    that occurs when enpassant and castling are added in. This requires enums and if/then
    logic processing

    Also, its true that available_moves, followed by end-game-conditions-check
    is the how to write these engines.

    instantiating the pieces is costly at each branch

    the correct level of abstraction for the Board is 
        piece vs. blank, 
        white-piece vs black-piece
        special-piece vs generic-piece. specials:
            king
            en-passant-vulnerable-pawn 
        ...nothing else needs to be considered at game-logic level, only
           further up at the stratgey-level.

    

    A board-move class holds dimensions of the board, the coloring and orietation, and
    the rules for the initial piece setup.
    Also, it holds the mathematical logic of the atomic moves:
        upacross [distance modifier] [w/wo player-direction-orientation e.g what is "move up"]
        diagonal [distance modifier] [w/wo player-direction-orientation]
        two_by_one
        

    The pieces then hold the business rules for which atomic move types they can perform and
    at what modification they can perform them, plus GameLedger modifications

        in addition to the Board is a Game-Ledger which tracks
            [king_can_castle | rook_can_castle]
            king_in_check
            turn_counter_while_solitary_king
            last_two_moves_tracker (for a 3-move-repeat-stalemate)
            pawn_advance_two can be held in the piece object

    Most rules are packed into available_moves routine
    
    Available_Moves_Player_P <- func(Board,Pieces,GameLedger)
        Available_Moves_i <- func(Piece_i,Board_current)
            <- filtered(king in check) Func(Board, Pieces)
               if GameLedger.check_flag
                    <- filtered(move-removes-check_flag)

    Then the strategy-module needs to consider the following info-blobs:
        Game board with pieces
        GameLedger
        Player_turn_current
        [turn_counter ?]
        ... everything else is derivative?
        
random thought: a mechanichal chess board is valuable to new variants of the rules that need
