This is to keep track of "scratch" work in the docs/ folder:

These are to investigate different modules / new code

==============================================================

3/17

adding:

    py3_imports/

    dealing with relative imports/packages in python3

8/30

adding:
    
    path_examples/

    wsl_thread/

    wrappers/

decriptions:

    path_examples/

    > Run p1.py from any directory in the worksapce:

        e.g. in path_examples/, from chess/, from basic_engine/src/
    
    ->  These should show how to get same relative paths regardless
        of calling examples. And how these are processed in imported
        modules.

    
    wsl_thread/

    > demo_wsl.py  contains notes about running WSL and flask within
                   from subprocess.

        - there is a problem about using a dummy cmd in 1 wsl-1-liner
        - there is notes about "signed on" bash having additional "powers"
        - there is flask specific notes
        - there is subproc specific notes

    > a.py          since wsl can't pipe to windows console, we can 
                    pipe to a file and read it. In this example, flask
                    outputs data to sterr that we are interested in,
                    and can use this output to know when the server 
                    is setup and ready to receive commands.

    
    wrappers/

        (this is older scratch work)

    > demo_wrap.py      a very simply wrapper example
        
    > demo_wrap2.py     a more complicated wrapper that allows
                        error handling with 1-line wrapper 
                        at the method. The rationale for this
                        is removing all the error handling to keep
                        methods terse.
